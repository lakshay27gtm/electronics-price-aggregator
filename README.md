# electronics-price-aggregator
Developed a Skyscanner-style electronics price aggregator that compares products across Amazon, Flipkart, Croma, and Reliance Digital to identify the lowest available price in real time. The platform improves consumer decision-making by standardizing multi-retailer data into a single, searchable web interface built using Python and Streamlit.
